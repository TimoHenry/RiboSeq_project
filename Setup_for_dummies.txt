# Good luck!


# 0) login to server:
# start VPN through FortiClient with tr10g082
# open any terminal or command prompt and type:
ssh $USER@binfservms01.unibe.ch                                                 # replace $USER with your username
# type in your password and wait to log in.

# 1) make or go to working-directory for this project:
cd /data/users/$USER
mkdir RNAseq                                                                    # make a project folder
cd RNAseq

# 2) install SRA-toolkit
mkdir 00_Software                                                               # make new directory to store all software
cd software                                                                     # go to that directory
wget --output-document sratoolkit.tar.gz http://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/sdk/current/sratoolkit.current-centos_linux64.tar.gz
tar -vxzf sratoolkit.tar.gz                                                     # unzip the just downloaded file

# 3) install FastQC




# 4) install bowtie




#5_a) download the processing script from github
cd /data/users/$USER/RNAseq/

# https://github.com/TimoHenry/RiboSeq_project/blob/main/BASH_it_all_SeqProcessing.sh

#5_B) clone the project from github                                             # you could also clone, or fork the underlying github repository and contribute to its extension.
git clone https://github.com/TimoHenry/RiboSeq_project.git                      # but if you're already into that, you probably would not need this 'dummies guide' for downloading software...

#6) Configure sra-toolkit before use
# To enable SRA-tools, it needs to be configured as described here:
# https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki/03.-Quick-Toolkit-Configuration
# note: you must give the path, to run vdb
./00_Software/sratoolkit.2.10.8.centos_linux64/bin/vdb-config -i                # if you are using the same directory-layout, run it like this.
# hint: specify the output directory as this: /data/users/$USER/RNAseq/01_Data/00_SRA_rawSeq

#7) run the processing script.
# type and run:
./BASH_it_all_SeqProcessing.sh                                                  # the '.' tells to look for the file in the current directory. This can be modified to any other location.
