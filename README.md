# RiboSeq_project
This is a repository for a course-project to learn how to analyse Ribosome-Profiling Sequencing data. It is part of the curriculum towards a M.Sc. in Bioinformatics degree at the universities of Bern or Fribourg in Switzerland -> check out their websites in case you're interested to learn this kind of stuff, I find it fun!
